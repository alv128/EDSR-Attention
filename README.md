# EDSR-Attention
Experiments with EDSR models with attention modules

This repository contains models based on the enhanced deep residual networks for single image super-resolution \
(EDSR), with the addition of various attention modules to improve the upscaling results. 


# Results on Set5, Set14 and Urban100
Set5, Set14 and Urban100 are commonly used datasets for image enhancement and super-resolution research.\
The metrics used for evaluating model performance and image reconstruction quality in general are\
the pixelwise signal-to-noise ratio PSNR and the structural similarity index metric SSIM. \
GIVE SHORT EXPLANATION OF THE METRICS HERE.\

Below table shows the results for Set5 and Set14, for x4 super-resolution.

Also, the results for the Urban100 dataset, which exposes images containing structures with a high-degree of self-similarity.
